	       	<h3 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-light" align="center">Shawarma</h3>
	        <p class="card-text text-light" style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Having to taste this food which is prepared by my dad gives me so much boost since the beef meat inside is well cooked and tender in which you could feel the juicyness in every bite! it could be partnered with rice or bread depending on your preference but I prefer it with the bread since the dough could match the meat perfectly and it has so much vegetables inside that will be unnoticeable since it is so yummy! Meanwhile, you could also have a garlic sauce with it or a hot sauce. There you have it, the all in 1 meat vegetable food that i like the most! </p>

	       <h3 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-light" align="center">Fatayer</h3>
	       <p class="card-text text-light">&nbsp &nbsp My Father also runs a business of this food, A fatayer is also a middlea eastern food that contains meat that is baked inside a dough. It could be either chicken, beef or cheese and spinach if you're a vegan person. This could be the known empanada in us filipino but this has so much spices to give it a much of a boost taste. The middle eastern loves it. so if i were to rate it ill give it a 10/10 since it doesn't need a sauce in order to taste better!</p>

	       <h3 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-light" align="center">Fatayer</h3>
	       <p class="card-text text-light">&nbsp This is a falafel it looks meaty but actually this is a pure vegetable that is deep fried it is perfectly taste like a meat too good for a kid who doesn't like to eat vegetables so i'll give this food a 10/10! This could also be partnered with a arabic bread or what we filipino's know is a pita and if you want it more tasty we could make a sauce that is called tahini although tahini could be perfectly blended with a pita alone! </p>
